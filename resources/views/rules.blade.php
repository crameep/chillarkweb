Too keep the server friendly for everybody we have set up some rules. 
Breaking these rules will result in warnings/bans or we will come over and kill 
some of your dinosaurs or structures. We will decide how big the offense is. 
Please note that we also give tribe warnings and the entire tribe will be held responsible.<br>
<h4>Griefing is not allowed</h4>
A griefer is a player who deliberately irritates and angers other players within the game,
without gaining any profit. You must see this as the following:<br>

You are a player with high level dinosaurs and proper resources and you are destroying
tribes with wooden/stone bases that will have no value for you. Raiding with the only 
intention to destroy bases without any profit will be seen as griefing.<br>
<h4>Swearing</h4>
We are a professional and mature server and expect everybody to uphold on this. We do not accept childish behaviour or swearing.
<h4>Abusing exploits</h4>
When there is an exploit and you abuse this you will be banned.
